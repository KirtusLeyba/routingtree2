# BGP-SAS
BGP-SAS (Border Gateway Protocol - Simulation, Analysis, and Storage) is a suite of tools for utilizing cluster computing (with MPI and Python via MPI4Py) to find routing-trees according to the Gao-Rexford model of routing. The algorithms used and an application of BGP-SAS are are detailed in the 2019 ACM SIGCAS COMPASS conference paper "Borders and Gateways: Measuring and Analyzing National AS Chokepoints".
